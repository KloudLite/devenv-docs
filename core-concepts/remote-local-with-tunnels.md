# Remote Local with Tunnels

Network tunnelling is a technique that allows you to create a secure connection between two computers over an insecure network, such as the internet. This can be useful when you want to access resources on a remote machine as if they were on your local machine or when you want to bypass network restrictions or security measures.

In the context of remote local development, network tunnelling can be used to create a secure connection between your local development machine and a remote development environment. This allows you to access the resources and tools on the remote machine as if they were on your local machine and can make it easier to work in a remote local development inner loop.

Various tools and technologies can be used to create network tunnels, including SSH (Secure Shell), VPN (Virtual Private Network), and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). These tools can create encrypted connections between your local machine and the remote development environment, allowing you to securely transfer data and access resources on the remote machine.

To use network tunnelling in a remote local development inner loop, you will typically need to set up the tunnelling software on both your local machine and the remote development environment. You can then use the tunnelling software to create a secure connection between the two machines and access the resources and tools on the remote machine as if they were on your local machine. This can make it easier to work with remote code and debug it remotely, as you can use your local development tools and workflows while running and testing the code on the remote machine.
