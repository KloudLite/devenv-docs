# Inner Dev Loop

### What is the Inner Dev Loop?

The inner development loop is the process a developer takes from writing their code to committing to a version control system, getting it ready to enter CI and ultimately deploying it to production. In traditional monolithic architectures, developers would check out their entire codebase and code locally with “live-reload” in their inner dev loop.\
