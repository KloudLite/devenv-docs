# Inner Dev Loop

### What is the Inner Dev Loop?

The inner development loop is the process a developer takes from writing their code to committing to a version control system, getting it ready to enter CI and ultimately deploying it to production. In traditional monolithic architectures, developers would check out their entire codebase and code locally with “live-reload” in their inner dev loop.\

### How does MicroServices change your inner loop?

With microservices, developers now have to manage external dependencies, builds, and implement orchestration configuration. All of these pieces add time to the dev loop and make the developer less productive.

With a slow development loop, the developer spends less time coding and more time toiling over configuration scripts and waiting.
