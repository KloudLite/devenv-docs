# What is Kloudlite DevEnv?

Kloudlite DevEnvs is a DevOps platform that is automated and redesigned to improve developers' productivity by reducing dev Innerloops. Developers can deploy production-like Environments in Seconds and access them locally.&#x20;

Using DevEnvs, developers can:

* Build & Debug services locally.
* Test and iterate on code change instantly instead of waiting for the deployment cycle.
* Collaborate with developers of dependent services to build and test the code simultaneously.
* Reduce Dev-Prod parity.
* Develop with a minimal footprint without setting up any local dependencies or services.
* Use their local development tools to develop and debug in remote environments.
